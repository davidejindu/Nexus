      content: `Campus life in North America offers numerous opportunities for international students to engage, learn, and grow. Understanding the social dynamics, campus resources, and cultural norms will help you navigate your university experience successfully.

**Key Campus Resources:**
Most universities offer international student orientation programs, cultural organizations, and support services. The International Student Office is your primary resource for guidance on academic and social matters.

**Social Interactions:**
American campus culture tends to be informal and inclusive. Students often study in groups, participate in clubs, and engage in campus events. Don't hesitate to introduce yourself to classmates and join study groups.

**Academic Culture:**
Class participation is highly valued. Professors encourage questions and discussions. Office hours are available for additional help - using them shows initiative, not weakness.

**Campus Activities:**
Universities offer hundreds of student organizations, from academic clubs to cultural groups to recreational activities. Joining these is one of the best ways to meet people and integrate into campus life.

**Communication Styles:**
Direct but polite communication is the norm. "Please" and "thank you" are used frequently. Small talk about weather, classes, or weekend plans is common and helps build relationships.`,

      title: 'General Mannerisms and Social Etiquette Guide',
      content: `Understanding North American social etiquette helps international students feel more confident in daily interactions and build meaningful relationships.

**Greetings and Introductions:**
A firm handshake, eye contact, and a smile are standard for formal introductions. Among peers, a simple "Hi" or "Hey" with a wave is common. First names are typically used, even with professors.

**Personal Space:**
Maintain about arm's length distance in conversations. Americans value personal space and may feel uncomfortable if you stand too close during casual conversations.

**Conversation Etiquette:**
Active listening is important - nod, maintain eye contact, and ask follow-up questions. Interrupting is generally considered rude. Wait for natural pauses to speak.

**Dining Etiquette:**
When eating in groups, it's polite to wait for everyone to be served before eating. Splitting bills ("going Dutch") is common among students. Tipping 15-20% at restaurants is expected.

**Time and Punctuality:**
Being on time is highly valued. Arriving 5-10 minutes early for appointments is ideal. If you're running late, text or call to inform others.

**Digital Etiquette:**
Respond to emails and messages within 24-48 hours when possible. Keep phones on silent in classrooms and meetings.`,

**Opening a Bank Account:**
Most banks require a Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), passport, I-20 form, and proof of enrollment. Many banks offer student accounts with no monthly fees.

**Types of Accounts:**
Checking accounts are for daily transactions, while savings accounts earn interest on stored money. Debit cards are linked to checking accounts for purchases and ATM access.

**Building Credit:**
Credit history is crucial in the US. Consider a secured credit card or student credit card to start building credit. Pay balances in full and on time to maintain good credit scores.

**Digital Banking:**
Most banking is done online or through mobile apps. Set up online banking to check balances, transfer money, and pay bills. Zelle and Venmo are popular for peer-to-peer payments.

**Important Fees to Avoid:**
Overdraft fees, ATM fees at other banks, and minimum balance fees. Read account terms carefully and monitor your balance regularly.

**Safety Tips:**
Never share your PIN or online banking passwords. Use ATMs at banks rather than standalone machines when possible.`,
